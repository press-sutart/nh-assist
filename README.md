# nh-assist
for men of culture

good stuff

what it can do:
1. open a doujin directly
2. preview a doujin (see tags)
3. get a random doujin (***doesn't work with blacklist)
4. list (search) doujins and sort by upload time or popularity
5. customize the assistant (blacklist)

todo:
1. adapt to discord as a bot
2. mOdUlAr PrOgRaMmInG
3. reading list/history (simple)
4. random but with blacklist (how???)
5. user preferences (how???)
